	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of how efficient an algorithm is  relative to the size of the input. Specifically, it describes how the runtime or number of operations needed by an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. </p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of 
		the input.When we say an algorithm has a <b>Space Complexity</b>
		of O(n) , t means that the amount of memory required grows linearly with 
		the size of the input n.</p>
