	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of how 
		efficient an algorithm is  relative to the size 
		of the input. Specifically, it describes how the runtime or number of operations needed 
		by an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. </p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of 
		memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of 
		the input.When we say an algorithm has a space complexity
		of O(n) , t means that the amount of memory required grows linearly with 
		the size of the input n.</p>
